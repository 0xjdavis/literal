# Personal Statement of David (Davood) Safdari
## Asylum Seeker from Iran

My name is David Safdari, born as Davood Safdari on March 15, 1988, in Tehran, Iran. I am seeking asylum in the United States due to persecution I have faced as a member of Iran's Jewish minority community. I am currently residing in Los Angeles, California, where I arrived on October 12, 2023, through LAX airport using a tourist visa that I obtained through considerable difficulty and expense.

### Background and Persecution in Iran

I come from one of the few remaining Jewish families in Tehran. My family has lived in Iran for generations, operating a textile business in the Tehran Bazaar since before the Islamic Revolution. While Iran officially recognizes Jews as a religious minority, the reality of our daily lives has become increasingly dangerous, especially since President Raisi took office.

The Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) began targeting our business in early 2022, accusing us of having "Zionist connections" because we imported some materials from Turkey, which they claimed were sourced from Israel. They started with weekly "inspections" of our shop, demanding to see all transaction records and questioning our employees about their religious beliefs.

### Specific Incidents Leading to Flight

The situation became critical in August 2023 when IRGC officers raided our home during Shabbat dinner, claiming they had evidence we were operating an "Israeli spy network" through our business connections. They confiscated our phones, computers, and business documents. My father was detained for three days and severely beaten. Upon his release, he had broken ribs and could barely walk.

The local Basij militia, working with the IRGC, began surveilling our synagogue and photographing members of our community. They spray-painted "Death to Jewish Spies" on our shop front and threatened our Muslim employees if they continued working for us. My name was specifically mentioned in a list of "suspected Zionist agents" that circulated in local hardline newspapers.

### Escape from Iran

After the raid and my father's detention, my family and I realized we could no longer safely remain in Iran. Through a contact in the Jewish community, I managed to secure a tourist visa to the United States, presenting myself as a businessman attending a textile trade show in Los Angeles. My wife, Sarah, and our two children (ages 4 and 6) remained behind with my parents, as we feared applying for multiple visas would raise suspicions.

I left Iran on October 10, 2023, flying first to Dubai, then to Los Angeles, arriving on October 12. I entered through LAX airport using my Iranian passport and tourist visa. Upon arrival, I immediately sought legal assistance to file for asylum.

### Current Situation

I am currently living with distant relatives in the Pico-Robertson area of Los Angeles, a community with a significant Iranian Jewish population. My wife and children remain in Tehran with my parents, maintaining the appearance of normal life while we work through legal channels to bring them to safety. They have moved in with my parents for protection, as our home was vandalized after my departure.

### Threat of Return

If I were deported to Iran, I would face immediate arrest at the airport. The IRGC has already charged me in absentia with "cooperation with the Zionist regime" and "spreading corruption on earth" (mofsed-e-filarz), charges that can carry the death penalty. My departure has been interpreted as admission of guilt by the authorities.

Several members of our Jewish community who faced similar accusations and remained in Iran have disappeared after being summoned for "questioning" by the authorities. One, my cousin Ebrahim, was sentenced to 15 years in Evin Prison in 2022 on fabricated espionage charges.

### Why the United States

While Israel accepts Jewish refugees, traveling there would confirm the false accusations against me and put my family in Iran at grave risk. The Iranian authorities monitor Jewish emigration to Israel closely, and such a move would be seen as definitive proof of their accusations.

Other countries in the region, such as Turkey or the UAE, maintain close ties with Iran and have histories of cooperating with Iranian authorities in returning accused persons. European countries, while potentially safe, lack the established Iranian Jewish community that can provide crucial support and cultural understanding during the asylum process.

The United States, particularly Los Angeles, has the largest Iranian Jewish community outside of Israel. This community provides essential support structures, cultural familiarity, and potential employment opportunities. Moreover, the U.S. has a strong record of protecting Iranian religious minorities and no extradition treaty with Iran.

### Supporting Evidence
- Documentation of business ownership in Tehran Bazaar
- Medical records of my father's injuries after detention
- Photographs of vandalized shop and home
- Copies of local newspaper articles listing me as a suspected agent
- Statements from Tehran Jewish Community members
- Documentation of property confiscation by IRGC
- Records of harassment complaints filed with local authorities (never addressed)
- Death threats received via text message from unknown numbers
- Bank records showing business account freezes by Iranian authorities

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
